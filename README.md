This is the source code to my personal website on https://idilsulo.github.io. 

Feel free to clone & adapt this repository for your own use.

Please make sure to remove / change the analytics tags as you would not want them on your own website.

## Setup

This site is built on top of [Jekyll Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) with changes to display publications and dark mode support.

To test this theme on your local, run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then, open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.
