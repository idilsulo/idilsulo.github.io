## Hi! I'm Idil,

a master's student in Informatics (Computer Science) at <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>.
I previously obtained my bachelor's in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://ceng.metu.edu.tr/">Middle East Technical University (METU/ODT√ú)</a>, Ankara. 
My interests include computer vision and deep learning research. 

Through my master's degree, I had the chance to work on self-supervised vehicle control at <a href="https://cvg.cit.tum.de/">TUM Computer Vision Group</a> under <a href="https://cvg.cit.tum.de/members/cremers">Prof. Daniel Cremers</a>. I am currently pursuing my master's thesis on zero-shot learning and 3D computer vision at <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/camp/">TUM CAMP Chair</a> under <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/senior-research-scientists/federico-tombari/">Dr. habil. Federico Tombari</a>.

In my free time, I like reading books, cycling and blogging:

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Cycling is one of the things that make me happy the most since my childhood. I participated in bike tours and even a MTB race in the past. Recently, I decided to go back to this good old habit of mine and bought myself a low-cost gravel / road bike. I frequently use [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/codingwoman) to log my cycling exercises, so feel free to check it out.

üìö Too many books, too little time! Lately, I came to the realization that even if I read 20 books every year, I can only finish 1000 books in 50 years which is a very little number when you think about all the books that you can find in a library. So, I started to read as regularly as I can. You can follow my recent books and reading challenges on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/codingwoman).

üë©‚Äçüíª Blogging is one of the things that motivates me the most to continue what I have been doing whether it be research, work or my hobbies. However, I find my Wordpress setup to be more organized and customizable, so I keep my blog on a separate domain. Feel free to visit my blog [Coding Woman](http://www.codingwoman.com)!
