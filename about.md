<p>
I'm İdil, a master's student in computer science department at <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Technical University of Munich</a> with an emphasis on Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I did my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently working part-time as a Data Scientist at a company named <a href="https://unetiq.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none">Unetiq</a>.

<p>
Last summer, I was a Computer Vision research intern at the Image Lab of Middle East Technical University. I had worked on Generative Adversarial Networks and MobileNets. After that, I took a graduate course named "Deep Learning: Methods and Applications".

<h1> Research Projects </h1>
  <h2> ÇIRAK Project </h2>
  <p>
  A project on an “intelligent” robot platform that will be developed to function as an apprentice for a human worker working in a factory assembly line under the supervision of Prof. Sinan Kalkan and Prof. Erol Şahin.
  </p>
  <p>
  This work is supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) through a project called “ÇIRAK: Compliant robot manipulator support for montage workers in factories” (project no 117E002).
  </p>
  
  <h2> Energy Efficient Smart Buildings Project </h2>
  <p>
  A project to apply deep learning methods on the energy consumption data obtained from the buildings that reside in the City University of New York (CUNY) campuses under the supervision of Prof. Theodore Brown.
  </p>
  <p>
  This work is supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) through the scope of the scholorship programme 2209/A University Students Research Project Grant.
