Last summer, I was a Computer Vision research intern at the Image Lab of Middle East Technical University. I had worked on Generative Adversarial Networks and MobileNets. Now, I'm taking a graduate course named "Deep Learning: Methods and Applications". Also, I am currently a part of a project named "Energy Efficient Smart Buildings Project" where I apply several deep learning techniques on the energy consumption data under the supervision of Prof. Theodore Brown.
